The provided code represents a simple implementation of a distributed mutual exclusion (DME) algorithm using Python's threading library. This DME algorithm is designed to ensure that only one client can access a critical section at any given time in a distributed system. Here's an overview of how the code works:

DistributedLock class:

The DistributedLock class is responsible for managing access requests and enforcing mutual exclusion among multiple clients.
It is initialized with the number of clients (num_clients) that will be participating in the DME algorithm.
request_access method:

This method is called by a client to request access to the critical section.
It uses a lock to ensure that access requests are processed sequentially.
The requesting client sets its request flag to True, increments its timestamp, and logs the request.
release_access method:

When a client is done with the critical section, it calls this method to release access.
It sets its request flag to False and logs the release action.
can_access method:

This method is called by a client to check whether it can access the critical section.
It checks the request status and timestamps of all clients and ensures that the client with the highest timestamp and the lowest client ID has access.
If a client can access the critical section, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
Logging:

The code uses Python's logging library to create log entries for each action taken by the clients. This is useful for tracking and debugging the DME algorithm.
It's important to note that this code provides a basic DME algorithm for educational purposes. In a real distributed system, more robust and fault-tolerant DME algorithms like Lamport's algorithm, Ricart-Agrawala algorithm, or Maekawa's algorithm would be preferred. These more advanced algorithms handle various scenarios, including network failures and crashed clients.

The code itself is not integrated with Apache ZooKeeper or the file server logic, but it serves as a starting point for implementing DME in a distributed system. To achieve mutual exclusion in a distributed environment, this algorithm would need to be incorporated into the file server and clients, possibly using ZooKeeper for distributed coordination and lock management, as discussed earlier.
